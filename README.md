## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note on Query Processing

### Deployment Constraints
The frontend is deployed on Vercel's Hobby (free) plan, which enforces a 60-second timeout limit on API routes. While our AI agent is capable of processing complex DeFi analysis queries successfully, the hosting platform automatically terminates requests exceeding this duration.

### Types of Affected Queries
Complex operations that might exceed the timeout include:
- Multi-protocol market analysis
- Comprehensive yield comparisons
- Detailed risk assessments across protocols
- Advanced portfolio optimization calculations

### Recommended Usage
For optimal experience:
- Break down complex analyses into smaller queries
- Use focused, specific questions for quick market checks
- Allow brief intervals between complex operations

### Solution for Production
For production environments requiring comprehensive market analysis:
- Upgrade to Vercel Pro plan for extended timeouts
- Consider self-hosting the API for custom timeout configurations
- Implement request chunking for complex operations

*Note: This limitation is purely hosting-related and does not affect the agent's analytical capabilities or accuracy of responses.*
